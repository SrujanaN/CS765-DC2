# Data Visualization : Design Challenge 2
It is a python application which takes sample datasets (schema similar to DC2 data provided) and creates five visualizations which is previously defined based on different areas like correlation, distribution, outliers.
 
This application focuses on creating a visualization based on datasets to give meaning information to the customers. I have played around ratings, review counts, category, product ID and userID (customer id) to create a meaning visualization.

The visualization lies in three areas:
1.	Correlation: Couple of visualization focus on deriving correlation between ratings and reviews concerning the customer, product and category.
2.	Distribution: Visualization which shows how data is distributed in the dataset which helps to come up with meaningful insights.
3.	Outliers: Every dataset has data which shows extreme behavior which sometimes must be neglected as it doesnâ€™t provide deeper insight into the data instead misguides us.

Interactive results for each design:
1. Distribution of no. of products based on price for a customer [link](https://srujanan.github.io/CS765-DC2/Product_Price_Count.html).
2. Customer review vs rating [link](https://srujanan.github.io/CS765-DC2/review_rating_cust.html)
3. Category (Product) with worst rating but popular [link](https://srujanan.github.io/CS765-DC2/Product_lowRating_highCount.html)
4. Category rating vs number of reviews [link](https://srujanan.github.io/CS765-DC2/Category_review_rating.html)
5. Distribution of rating over category [link](https://srujanan.github.io/CS765-DC2/Category_Rating.html)
